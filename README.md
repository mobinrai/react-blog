# MyBlog
MyBlog is a full-stack blog application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It features user authentication, rich text editing, infinite scrolling, and image uploads — all wrapped in a clean, modern UI.

## 🔧 Components Breakdown:

<b>1. MongoDB (M) </b> <br>
A NoSQL database used to store application data in a flexible, JSON-like format. <br>
Example: User profiles, blog posts, comments.

<b> Express.js (E) </b> <br>
A lightweight Node.js web framework used to build RESTful APIs and handle backend routing.<br>
 Example: API routes for user registration or blog creation.

<b> React (R) </b> <br>
A front-end JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces, particularly single-page applications (SPAs).<br>
 Example: Interactive blog pages, forms, and navigation.

<b> Node.js (N) </b> <br>
A JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side.
Used to power the Express.js server and connect to MongoDB.

## 🔁 How It Works Together:

<b> Frontend (React): </b> <br>
Sends HTTP requests to the backend (e.g., via axios or fetch).
Displays UI, handles state, user input, and routing.

<b> Backend (Express + Node): </b> <br>
Receives requests, processes logic, communicates with MongoDB.
Sends data (JSON) back to the frontend.

<b> Database (MongoDB):</b> <br>
Stores data like users, posts, or media files.
